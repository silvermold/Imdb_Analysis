In this analysis I try to answer the question "Are Newer Movies Dying?" This project requires me to webscrape data from Imdb's Top 100 Most Popular and Top 250 lists of movies. The data was then cleaned and visualized using Python and the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. A presentation was also created in PDF slideshow format to communicate my findings.
